    "🌹 Hospital Appointment No-Show Analysis\n",
    "📖 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores factors that influence whether patients attend or miss their hospital appointments. The main questions investigated are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Does receiving an SMS reminder reduce no-show chances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which age groups miss appointments the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there patterns in attendance across different ages?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is done using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "📂 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains patient appointment information, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Age\n",
    "\n",
    "SMS_received (0 = No SMS, 1 = SMS sent)\n",
    "\n",
    "No-show (Yes/No)\n",
    "\n",
    "Appointment day vs scheduled day\n",
    "\n",
    "Other demographic and medical features\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠 Methods Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning (handling invalid ages like −1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering (WaitingTime)\n",
    "\n",
    "Groupby analysis for age and SMS\n",
    "\n",
    "No-show rate calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Line chart visualizatioin\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Key Findings\n",
    "1. Age strongly affects no-show rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Young patients (0–20 years) have the highest no-show rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adults (20–60 years) show more stable and lower no-show rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Older adults (60–80 years) attend appointments more reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very elderly data (90+) is unstable due to very small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SMS reminders were not as effective as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "Many patients who received SMS still missed their appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMS line stays above the no-SMS line for several ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMS alone is not enough to guarantee attendance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Age 115 had a 75% no-show rate\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is based on a very small number of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is considered an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 Line Chart Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The line chart shows no-show rate by age for:\n",
    "\n",
    "People who received SMS\n",
    "\n",
    "People who did not receive SMS\n",
    "\n",
    "The two lines help visualize how attendance changes with age and SMS reminders.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧾 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Appointment attendance is influenced more by age than by SMS reminders. SMS reminders alone do not significantly reduce no-show rates. Young patients are the biggest contributors to missed appointments, while older adults attend more reliably. Future strategies should target:\n",
    "\n",
    "Young patients\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple reminder methods (calls, same-day SMS, app notifications)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas\n",
