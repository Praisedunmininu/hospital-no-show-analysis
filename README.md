Summary
This project analyzes hospital appointment attendance to understand why some patients fail to show up (“no-shows”). The focus is on three key factors: patient age, SMS reminders, and overall no-show patterns.
Using Python and data visualization, the project compares no-show rates across different ages and investigates whether receiving an SMS reminder affects attendance.

The analysis helps hospitals identify which age groups are most at risk of missing appointments and whether reminder messages are effective.

 — 💠Insights From the Line Chart 

The line chart compares no-show rates by age for two groups:
    • Patients who received an SMS reminder
    • Patients who did NOT receive an SMS reminder

   Key Insights

1 Children and young adults (0–20 years)

  • They have the highest no-show rates.

  • Even when they receive SMS reminders, they still miss more appointments.

  • This suggests SMS reminders alone may not be enough for this group.

2  Adults between ages 20–60

 • No-show rates become more stable and lower.

 • SMS reminders only make a small difference.

3 Older adults (60–80)

• They have lower and more consistent attendance.

• They seem more likely to keep appointments regardless of SMS.

4 Very elderly patients (90+)

• The line becomes unstable because the number of patients is very small.

• Example: Age 115 has 75% no-show, but this is based on only a few people.

5 Overall effect of SMS

• Surprisingly, the SMS line remains higher than the No-SMS line for many ages.

• This means receiving an SMS did not guarantee better attendance.

—💠 Compare Age Groups 
 Young patients (0–20 years)

• Highest no-show rates

• SMS does not significantly reduce missed appointments

• Possibly rely on parents/guardians, which affects attendance

 Adults (20–60 years)

• Most reliable group

• More consistent no-show rates

• SMS reminders have a small but steady effect

Older adults (60–80 years)

• Very good attendance

• SMS reminders make little difference (they already attend well)

Very elderly (90+)

• Data is unstable due to very low sample size



—💠 Project Conclusion 

Conclusion
The analysis shows that appointment attendance is strongly related to age, and that SMS reminders alone are not enough to reduce no-show rates. Young patients are the most likely to miss appointments, while older adults attend more consistently. Although SMS reminders were expected to improve attendance, the results show that many patients who received SMS still did not show up.

Hospitals may need additional strategies—such as follow-up calls, reminders on the same day, or targeted communication for young patients—to reduce no-show rates.
